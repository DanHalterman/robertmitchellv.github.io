                <p>In a recent FiveTirtyEight post by <a href="https://twitter.com/cragcrest">Christie Aschwanden</a> 
about researcher bias and P-Hacking, there is a lovely interactive example of what
variables a researcher would need include/exclude in the analysis in order to 
obtain a result that is statistically significant, i.e., <em>p&le;.05</em>; thus worthy 
of publishing.  The article brought many thoughts to mind, which I am using this
blog post to note.  The crux of the article, I feel, rests in the following
passage from the article:   </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-1x"></i>The important lesson here is that a single 
analysis is not sufficient to find a definitive answer. Every result is a 
temporary truth, one that’s subject to change when someone else comes along to 
build, test and analyze anew.<i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-1x"></i><sup id="fnref:1"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This annotates the concept of truth; introducing time and the transitory nature
of what we know as 'truth'.  However, if we can think about what it means for
some subject <em>to be</em> at one point in time and <em>to be</em> at some other point in time,
this, again, introduces the concept of ontology; i.e., what does it mean for a
subject to exist?  There is a very novel explanation from <a href="http://joseph-t-tennis.squarespace.com/">Joseph
Tennis</a> that describes how both time
and ontology interact that I would like to introduce: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-1x"></i>Knowledge changes through time.
Classification schemes as tools for accessing knowledge undergo constant
revision.  It is impossible to claim that the ontology of subjects and their
interrelationships, once established by a classificationist, remain constant
within that scheme.  As revisions to classification schemes emerge, so too do
new subjects.  These, new parts of the updated classification scheme are
elements in a formal system&mdash;elements that represent the current interpretation
of knowledge.<i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-1x"></i><sup id="fnref:2"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is both simple and profound.  <em>Time</em> is an interesting concept and it has,
for the most part, been missing from the philosophical discourse from
Heraclitus to Heidegger.<sup id="fnref:3"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>  If we can remember from the <em>Heraclitus
Fragments</em>, "You cannot step twice into the same stream. For as you are
stepping in, other waters are ever flowing on to you".<sup id="fnref:4"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>  This statement is
perhaps the most profound philosophical aphorism I have encountered since I
began to love learning.  It decimates our ability to truly understand things
metaphysically.<sup id="fnref:5"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:5" rel="footnote">5</a></sup>  Nevertheless, it lets you peek, at least in part, at something 
beyond our anthropocentric naive empiricism.  This is important, because there
is rich meaning in the way subjects change over time&mdash;it can tell us a lot
about ourselves.  There is another passage I like in Tennis' paper that I'd
like to return to:    </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-1x"></i> What kind of access is granted by a
classification system that shows how knowledge has changed, verses one that
revises classes, denying access to the classificationist's interpretation of
the change in knowledge?  With each revision, a scheme for classification cuts
itself off from its previous view of knowledge, building an artificial boundary
of time.  There are other rhetorical questions pertinent to time as it relates
to subject access.  For example, could one access the array of subjects in
higher education that were taught during Plato's Greece?  Through a
classification scheme, can one collocate the works of proto-anthropologists?
These knowledges are not reflected in classification schemes, because each
living scheme needs to be revised to be viable&mdash;thereby eliminating the fossil
record of literary warrant.  To what degree do revised classification schemes
blind us to how subjects change and are re-collocated through time?  What can
knowledge organization thery do to help the sophisticated user re-collocate
knowledge through time?  This can be answered by charting the development of a
class in a classification system through time.  In other words, this can be
answered by charting the subject's ontogeny.<sup id="fnref:6"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:6" rel="footnote">6</a></sup><i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-1x"></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This really reminds me a lot of Heidegger's <em>On the Origin of the Work of Art</em>
and both his concept of "world" and the "work of art", which has its own poetic
interaction.  A former professor of mine at UCLA named John McCumber helped
shape the way I think philosophically.  He was one of the most intimidating
professors I had; able to recall from memory huge passages of Hegel, Heidegger,
and Nietzsche in German, fluent in French, and writing ancient Greek and Latin
on the whiteboard when explaining concepts.  In his book <em>Poetic Interaction: 
Language, Freedom, Reason</em>, there is a passage I think ties some of these
floating ideas together:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-1x"></i>[P]reserving the work of art
functions similarly to Being-toward death in <em>Being and Time</em>.  Heidegger in
fact goes on to relate the preservation of the work of art to the concept of
"resoluteness" presented in the book.  But the difference is unmistakeable.
The inarticulateness of resolve in <em>Being and Time</em> is replaced with the
concrete individuality of the work of art, which speaks to us, not from within
our world or as an indeterminate "call" out of it, but from another concrete
world, one unique to itself.  This way of experiencing a work of art is a
condition for its being a work of art at all.  An art work which does not
deserve an audience, we must say, is no art work.  This is why, in experiencing
a work of art for what it is, we "preserve" it; and it is why, for Heidegger as
for Hegel, the work of art is intrinsically a communal and (in a broad sense) a
communicative entity.<sup id="fnref:7"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:7" rel="footnote">7</a></sup><i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-1x"></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This may be confusing at first, because the quote is taken a bit out of
context, but the phrase that captivates me is the section where McCumber talks
of the work of art being preserved within its own world.  Ontologically this is
fascinating because the work of art has aged&mdash;it is not as it was when created.
Moreover, it is not necessarily a part of this world either; it is preserved in
some capacity.  My main interest in subject ontogeny is the attemp to make
explicit the effect time has on our body of knowledge.  Being able to
understand what encyclopedic resources were available when Plato was alive is a
form of artistic expression because it crafts an experience that people can
interact with&mdash;it would preserve Plato's world in a small sense and that world
would rest apart from our own world.  That we could be transported is the
exciting notion; that we could stretch our conceptions, biases, cultural
stereotypes, all the mental baggage we carry around in our mind from being
thrown into the world at this particular time in its existence&mdash;this would
provide perspective that moves our species forward. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, what does this have to do with P-Hacking?  It is that truth is
temporary.  Results, data, these things are not stateless; they say as much
about this time that we are doing research as they do informing us of new
temporary truths.  We could argue about what is currently axiomatic and how
certain certainties are foundational, but this is only an affirmation of a kind
of thinking that <em>needs</em> the external world to conform to our senses and
instruments to make meaning.  As humans we are always making meaning and
mistakes&mdash;those things go hand in hand.  Like biological life, knowledge is 
iterative and it evolves.  As our knowledge evolves, so too should our way of
describing that evolution.  The philosophical notion of <em>ontology</em> can be
therefore connection to the information science concept of <em>ontology</em><sup id="fnref:8"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:8" rel="footnote">8</a></sup> if we
are able to represent human knowledge's interrelationships that describe what we
know, temporally, to be true for all domains of discourse in as many ways as
can be accurately and approximately completed.  Such an ontology would reflect 
in an abstract and concrete way what it is to be human.  What would tell us 
who we are.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Science is a bit of a dialectic&mdash;there is movement in going from an unknown to
a known that has a <em>telos</em> that can and should be represented in an ontology.
Therefore, to say that we know something is to make an epistemological
statement, which begs an epistemological question: how do you know that?  When
our understanding of science is as Aschwanden says: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><i class="fa fa-quote-left fa-1x"></i>Science is not a magic wand that turns 
everything it touches to truth.  Instead, "science operates as a procedure of
uncertainty reduction [...] [t]he goal is to get less wrong over time."  This
concept is fundamental&mdash;whatever we know now is only our best approximation of
the truth.  We can never presume to know everything.<sup id="fnref:9"><a class="footnote-ref" href="#fn:9" rel="footnote">9</a></sup><i class="fa fa-quote-right fa-1x"></i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That this line of thinking is novel for people in STEM fields is as
disconcerting as the lack of statistical knowledge in the humanities.  I see
this as perhaps the most pervasive mistake in higher education.  On the one
hand, we are told not to be a generalist; to specialize, to find a niche and
exploit it.  On the other hand, we miss out on perspectives, ways of thinking,
and challenges that provoke deeper thinking than would normally be the case.
In working toward teaching myself computer science and mathematics, I am
continually pushing myself to broaden my understanding of the world.  How are
STEM only researchers doing the same?  Without a complete education that covers
all domains at least in part we lack the tools to truly understand the 21st
century.  We need interdisciplinary teams of interdisciplinarians; not callow
one-faceted domain caricatures that cannot think in multiple loci.  I believe
this will enable humanity to probe deeper into complexity and how ecologically 
interdependent we all are on Earth.</p>
