### The brief bio
>I am a new dad, husband, and recent Master of Information Science recipient who is passionate about code, complexity, design, dichotomy busting, cuisine, travel, + striving for balance across the board in my life.  I love conceptual thinking and am expanding my worldview through the acquisition of knowledge, practices, + techniques of both mathematics, physics, and traditional sciences&#8212;which I, _foolishly + in youthful obstinance_, dismissed while searching for some deeper philosophical meaning.  This paradigm shift has led me to pursue further graduate/research/doctoral studies in a computational science/computer science/artificial intelligence/NetSci/CX program (forthcoming!).

My background is rooted in theology, philosophy, and continental thought.  This formed the basis for my academic exploration.  My BA was in both French and comparative literature.  In the US, the ‘comp lit’ field is dominated by literary criticism + the search for universal truths and archetypes in global literature, which is not always apparent from the field’s name.  Additionally, I took a fair amount of philosophy courses (my major originally), German language, literature, art, and philosophy courses with a bit of Scandinavian literature + film courses and a couple courses on dead languages here and there.  

My Master’s degree is in Information Science (MS-IS).  Furthermore, I also completed both the Information Systems program of study; a narrower focus within the MS-IS degree as well as a Graduate Academic Certificate (GAC) in Digital Content Management.  The MS-IS is designed for information work in many different fields from information brokerage, database analysts, chief information officer, user experience designer, information architect, knowledge manager, system librarian, and many more.  The information systems track taught me how to support my organization to gain strategic and tactical competitive advantages, which we can call knowledge management or business intelligence.  It supports more technical knowledge and builds more technical skills than the other tracks within the MS-IS.  Last, the GAC in Digital Content Management provided me with a theoretical foundation + conceptual toolkit to help me manage digital content, build applications, and develop services that respond to institutional + individual user needs.

I’ve been lucky enough to do a fair amount of traveling; a few months in Japan at 19, a year in Paris at 23/24, summer in Germany and Scandinavia at 24, and some quick trips to different places while spending quality time in these locations.  These experiences have shaped who I am as an individual, before I hit on a girl sitting across from me on the Metro, eventually marrying her (best impulsive move ever).

I have recently turned 31 and can attest to the calming wave of moving beyond the undertow of trends + fads, i.e., generally caring too much about what isn’t important.   Being a dad has only amplified this, as I no longer feel tied to a concept of ‘cool’; rather, I evaluate content alone for quality.

I hope to contribute posts on my site that interact with my interdisciplinary interests with special focus on the semantic relationships between objects and concepts.  I’m not always as interested in the epistemological aspect of things as I might appear–really I think I enjoy metaphysical speculation (otherwise, why would I have become interested in philosophy at all?).  I believe that everything is connected, and the 21st century will be about discovering these connections—hopefully I can be a part of this.
