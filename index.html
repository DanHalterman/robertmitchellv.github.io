  			<h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
  			<p>This site exists as an online handshake. I hope that it <br>
  				gives a sense of who I am, what I'm interested in, <br>
  				how I think, + where I'm going.  I have lots of interests + I hope to monitor them over time with this site. You can start by reading about me, reading what I write, reading what I say, or looking at what I do to get to know me. <br>
  				I'm here to learn!</p>
