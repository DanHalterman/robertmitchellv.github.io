## <i class="fa fa-compass fa-lg"></i>  Personal Philosophy

&nbsp;

<ul>
  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i>  <strong>I believe that the 
21st century requires a more multifaceted toolkit if we hope to solve complex 
challenges&#8212;process + task oriented approaches balanced within a 
framework that fosters strategic thinking.  That interdisciplinary 
relationships can be strengthened through active community participation&#8212;
working toward something with the shared value of doing good.</strong>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<ul>
  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i>  <strong>I bring a lot of 
energy + enthusiasm to the projects that I become involved in.  I thrive in 
situations that require imagination + innovation.  I have a broad range of 
interests; from academic inquiry, classical and contemporary thought, the 
music + cuisine of other cultures, the arts, travelling, languages; to a 
passion for social justice, education for all people, + that our most 
vulnerable deserve respect + to be treated with dignity + fairness</strong>
</ul>

&nbsp;

<ul>
  <i class="fa fa-angle-double-right fa-lg"></i>  <strong>Ultimately I hope
that the work I do is helpful&8212;that it enables discovery or provides
clarity.  The gamut of which is not narrow, but wide&#8212;a lot can be helpful
or meaningful.  Things practical and principled.  I hope to further grow as
this philosophy guides me.</strong>
